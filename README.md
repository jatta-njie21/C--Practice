TASKS

(1) Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd (e.g. 2011) and performs the following actions:

– Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 2+0+1+1 = 4).

– Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our example 1102).

– Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 1201).

– Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 2101).


(2) Write a program that applies bonus points to given scores in the range [1…9] by the following rules:
– If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.

– If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.

– If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.

– If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints an error message.
