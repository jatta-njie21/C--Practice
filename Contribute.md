Project is designed to target both beginners and intermediate .net developers who code using c# by adding tasks and solutions to the project. It has a unit test solution but if you are new to the concept just focus on the task solution project. After going through the installation section some of the links recommended all have a set of questions or task to solve. If you want to add a new link first add the link and then the task to be completed.
